"""
Given an integer n, break it into the sum of k positive integers, where k >= 2, and
maximize the product of those integers.

Return the maximum product you can get.

Example 1:

Input: n = 2
Output: 1
Explanation: 2 = 1 + 1, 1 Ã— 1 = 1.

# Solved using the idea that when you break down a number into it twos and threes, the product of these will be the
maximum
